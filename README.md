# Project: Neighborhood Map

This is the fifth project of the Udacity's Full Stack Web Developers Nanodegree.

The project consists in developing a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood I would like to visit ([Easter Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island)).


Some functionality was added to this map including **highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.
