# Project: Neighborhood Map

This is the fifth project of the Udacity's Full Stack Web Developers Nanodegree.

The project consists in developing a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood I would like to visit ([Easter Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island)).

The app has 8 places from the Easter Island:

- [Orongo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orongo)
- [Ahu Akivi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahu_Akivi)
- [Ahu Tahai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahu_Tahai)
- [Ahu Tongariki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahu_Tongariki)
- [Ahu Vinapu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahu_Vinapu)
- [Anakena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anakena)
- [Puna Pau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puna_Pau)
- [Rano Raraku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rano_Raraku)

Some functionality was added to this map including:
- Search bar to filter the name of the places;
- Highlight the locations when clicking the name in the list view;
- When clicking in the marker of the place show a photograph from [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/).
